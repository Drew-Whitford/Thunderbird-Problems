# Thunderbird-Problems

Latest update of Thundbird to 68.3.0 (32-bit) resulted in only about a dozen exists emails being ported in to the new version and complete lose of contacts and address book

Any suggestions before I simply uninstall the lastest version and revert to the previous.
Never had this issue before
